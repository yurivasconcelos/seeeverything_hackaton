Intro:

Just to give a bit of ground on how our SAAS work, 
and of course, for those who are not familiar with the yaml configurations, basically we have an yaml file
where you can define how the customer dashboard should look like. 

Just to exemplify, 
have a look at this screenshot below
[screenshot with yaml in one side and the dashboards in the other]


(so let's say that you wanna retrieve another field or column to this grid, you basically need to add a few configurations)


1) problem:
as we onboard more and more customers, more people will be required to work on these yaml configurations (dashboards, forms, featureToogles, notifiers etc.).
Today, only a few people can maintain these yamls. First, because these options are changing all the time as we add more and more features
but also because is really easy to break... 

2) Easy to break:

Let's say that you change one of these values.. 

screenshot 2: (wrong key)

as you can see here, that's how the dashboard will look like if you change one thing that is not quite right.
I am pretty sure everyone who ever worked on these, experienced this. 
And I am talking about people with 5, 10 years of software development experience

 
Solution:


Server:
NodeJS SchemaValidation API that basically contains the definitions of these yamls, based on the code-base of the services and the front-end.

Consumer:
1) Our first SeeEverything visual studio code extension, which uses the SchemaValidation API and validates the schema as you are typing.
2) ToolChain also uses the same SchemaValidation API, ensuring that we only update valid schemas




This is more like an idea than a real implementation but I have done some work on how this should look like:
